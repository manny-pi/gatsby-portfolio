Differential equations are used in a variety of domains. Ranging from fluid mechanics, economic models,
and ... (the list goes on, considerably). For us here, we're interested in it's applications in Artificial
Intelligence. 

Recent papers have shown that differential equations can be used to denoise *noisy* probability distributions,
and it's remarkable the amount of progress that they've made. You can view more about this in the several blog
post reviews of the papers that I believe best describe why the methods of differential calculus are important.

That said, many of us my need a review of the concepts that are applied in these papers. So, I've created this 
page, and dedicated it to refreshing your mind on these things.

# Prerequisites

In order to understand the material on this page, you need to have the following foundational knowledge:
- Basic algebra
- Differentiability

# Definition

A differential equation is an equation consisting of expressions that contain a function and one, or several
of its derivatives.
