                Here, we're going to learn about computer systems, and how they come together to enable the
                functionality that we rely to execute tasks everyday. I'll be discussing the details of software
                and hardware implementations from a "10,000-foot level", but I'll also be providing sufficient
                detail that <em>should</em> any immediate questions you might have.
            </p>
            <p>
                It would be impossible to cover every detail of the software and hardware components of computers. So,
                the purpose of this post is generally to introduce to the vocabulary you'll generally be using when
                having discussions about computer systems.
