        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the most popular technology at this moment in history: 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
            But, it's misunderstood - by the general public, specifically.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most individuals are familiar with the phrases "Large Language Model", "Hallucination", "Neural Network", e.t.c. 
            While their [popularity has exploded recently](forbes.com/sites/roberthart/2024/07/18/what-ai-is-the-best-chatbot-arena-relies-on-millions-of-human-votes/),
            these terms come from a specific field in AI called **Deep Learning**. Other approaches to developing intelligent systems exist,
            and several distinguished individuals in the field have encouraged the larger community to consider incorporating
            the methods from these fields. However, questionable hostility from promoters of the neural network approach may be
            impeding progress towards building more capable systems that combine efforts from the other domains of AI.
        </p>
        <p>
            This post is not a report on the political landscape of the domain of AI. Rather, it's a brief *survey*
            of one of the most promising methods that can be combined with deep learning techniques: **Symbolic AI**.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll describe each paradigm by focusing on the objectives of the methods they use, and we'll discuss some
            real-world examples that showcase the potential of this hybrid approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            Let's begin by establishing the vocabulary that we'll be using in this article.

        <h2>What is a model?</h2>
        <p>
            Humans are curious creatures. We like to study phenomenon, determine how they begin,
            what sustains their existence. There are several ways to satisfy these interests,
            but our *best and brightest* formalized a multi-step process to ensure that we do so effectively
            and accurately. This process is called the **scientific method**:
            <ol>
                <li>Define a question</li>
                <li>Gather information</li>
                <li>Form an explanatory hypothesis</li>
                <li>Test the hypothesis by performing an experiment and collecting data in a reproducible manner</li>
                <li>Analyze the data</li>
                <li>Interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for a new hypothesis</li>
                <li>Publish results</li>
                <li>Retest</li>
            </ol>
            Over time, we'll take several measurements of these changes, and this collection
            of measurements is referred to as <b>data</b>.

            The objective of a neural network is to identify patterns in data, such that they can be queried.
