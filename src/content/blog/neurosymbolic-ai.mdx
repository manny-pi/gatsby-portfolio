        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the most popular technology at this moment in history: 2024.
        </p>
        <p>
            But, it's misunderstood. By the general public, specifically.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most individuals are familiar with the phrases "Large Language Model", "Hallucination", "Neural Network", e.t.c. But, these keywords are
            products of a branch of AI called **Deep Learning**. Other approaches to developing intelligent systems exist,
            and several prominent individuals in the field have encouraged the larger community to consider incorporating
            the methods from the domains. However, questionable hostility from promoters of the neural network approach may be
            impeding progress towards more capable systems.
        </p>
        <p>
            This post is not a report on the political landscape of the domain of AI. Rather, it's a brief survey
            of one of the most promising methods that can be combined with deep learning techniques called **Symbolic AI**.

        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
            It's simply this: <b>Automation</b>. The objective of AI research is singular, and it is to "create machines
            that can perform physical and cognitive tasks at least as well as a human." By nature, this objective
            comes with many caveats, but those would take away from the discussion at this point. So, for now,
            we'll focus on this objective, and its implications.

        <h2>What is a model?</h2>
        <p>
            Human's are curious creatures. We like to study phenomenon, and understand how they are generated,
            and what sustains their existence. An important step in this process is taking measurements of physical changes caused
            by these phenomenon. Over time, we'll take several measurements of these changes, and this collection
            of measurements becomes <b>data</b>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once our collection of measurements (referred to as "data"). [ ]. Mathematics is the tool of choice.
