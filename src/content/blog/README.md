# Learn With Me

Essentially, this is a publicly-viewable progress tracker, and a platform for users to provide input and adjust. This is a collection of all the subjects I'm learning; the resources I'm using to learn them; and how far along I am in my journey with each subject.

## What is this?

I'm a life-long learner, and I keep finding things that interest me. From building circuits with Arduino boards, to self-hosting websites on Raspberry Pi, I always something new to build all the time.

This is good. However, with an ever-increasing number of subjects, tracking my progress in each has become very important. Also very important is having a community of makers that can provide input on how I can improve my process in any odd subject. So, I'm making this page to accomplish those two things.

## How does it work?

I use several resources when I'm learning a subject. From books to online courses, I use anything and everything that helps me improve.
